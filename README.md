# **Crop Recommendation Analysis**

This project aims to analyze and explore a dataset for crop recommendations using Python. The code performs basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset structure, detect potential issues, and visualize insights.

---

## **Dataset**
- **File:** `Crop_recommendation.csv`
- **Description:** Contains features like temperature, humidity, and soil type, along with the crop label for recommendations.

---

## **Dependencies**
The following libraries are required to run the code:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install them using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

---

## **Code Functionality**
1. **Loading and Inspecting Data**
   - The dataset is loaded using `pandas` and basic inspection is performed:
     - `head()`, `tail()`, `shape`, and `info()` methods.
     - Checks for missing and duplicated values using `isnull().sum()` and `duplicated().sum()`.
     - Descriptive statistics generated using `describe()`.

2. **Basic Exploration**
   - Column names and value counts for categorical columns (`label`) are explored.
   - Unique value counts and data types for all columns are analyzed.

3. **Visualizations and Summaries**
   - **Correlation Matrix:** Heatmap created using `seaborn` to visualize relationships between numerical features.
   - **Distribution Plots:** Histogram with density curves for numerical columns to study data spread.
   - **Category Count Plots:** Bar plots to analyze the frequency of categorical values.

4. **Custom Functions**
   - Display first or random rows of the dataset.
   - Summarize specific columns (unique values, missing values, most frequent values).
   - Visualize distributions of numerical features and counts for categorical data.

## **How to Use**
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
2. Place the dataset file (`Crop_recommendation.csv`) in the `dataset/` folder.
3. Run the script to explore the data:
   ```bash
   python analysis.py
   ```

## **Improvements**
1. **Column Summaries:** Added detailed insights for each feature, such as unique and missing values, to simplify data cleaning and validation.
2. **Distribution Plots:** Enhanced understanding of numerical feature distributions and detection of outliers using KDE curves.

---

## **Results**
The analysis highlights relationships between features and provides key insights into crop recommendations based on environmental and soil conditions. Further steps could involve building predictive models for crop recommendation.
